# Python m68k cpu simulator

Using the [Musashi](https://github.com/kstenerud/Musashi) C library.

Simulates Motorola 68000 / 68010 / 68020 / 68030 / 68040 CPU.


Another interesting project is [Amitools](https://github.com/cnvogelg/amitools) that
also has an embedded Musashi library but goes a step further and tries to
create a portable Amiga execution environment and tools.
